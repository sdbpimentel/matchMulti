Description: Performs multilevel matches for data with cluster-level treatments and individual-level outcomes using a network optimization algorithm.  Functions for checking balance at the cluster and individual levels are also provided, as are methods for permutation-inference-based outcome analysis.  Details in Pimentel et al. (2017+), forthcoming in the Annals of Applied Statistics.
